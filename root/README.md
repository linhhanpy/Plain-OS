

#### 1. Overview
The custom operating system project is designed to demonstrate the fundamental
principles of operating system development using NASM assembly language. 
It provides a minimalistic environment for executing basic commands and 
interacting with hardware directly. This project serves as an educational tool
to help developers understand low-level system operations and the interaction
between software and hardware.

#### 2. Functionality
This operating system supports several core functionalities:
- **Command Execution**: Users can input simple commands to perform tasks such
as displaying text, clearing the screen, or shutting down the system.
- **Hardware Interaction**: Direct communication with hardware components like
the keyboard and display is implemented.
- **Memory Management**: Basic memory allocation and deallocation mechanisms
are included to manage system resources effectively.

#### 3. Commands
Below is a list of supported commands within the custom OS:
- `echo`: Displays a given string on the screen.
- `clear`: Clears all text from the screen.
- `shutdown`: Halts the system and stops all processes.
- `help`: Lists all available commands and their descriptions.

#### 4. Usage Methods
To interact with the custom operating system:
1. Boot the system into the NASM-based environment.
2. Input commands via the keyboard interface.
3. Observe the output on the display or other connected devices.

For example, to display a message:
```nasm
echo "Hello, World!"
```

#### 5. Notes
- The system is designed for educational purposes only and may not support 
advanced features found in modern operating systems.
- Ensure that the hardware meets the minimum requirements specified in the 
project documentation before attempting to run the OS.
- Modifications to the source code should be performed carefully to avoid 
disrupting the system's stability.
